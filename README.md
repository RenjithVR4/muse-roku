Muse - A Roku Music Player
==========================

Muse is a purpose-built audio player for the Roku platform that
focuses on the music itself, now how it's delivered.  It's goal in
life is to let you find and listen to your personal music
collection, without getting in the way.

This is highly opinionated software.  If you don't want to manage
your music collection entirely from [muse][muse], you might want
to look elsewhere.
